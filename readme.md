No one reads these... right?

Here is a jumbly mess of code and such that actually makes a functioning game! There is HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, Bootstrap, duct tape and wishes holding this thing together. 

I took a couple stabs at it when starting, and I really wish that I went with the first stab, because the first stab had less drawnout JS and more jQuery. I decided to go with my second attempt because I got stuck on some jQuery in the start, but had to move on with the project by myself. After getting half way through the project I quickly realized that organization is VERY important and the shorter you can write things, the better.

Anyways, It's late and I want to go to bed. I promise that I will clean up my code, improve the style of the page and re-write the readme file. Only a maybe on the last one though.

All in all, it was challenging and a lot of fun. Please don't judge me on grammar and spelling, it's too late to even read this again.
